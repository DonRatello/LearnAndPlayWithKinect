# LearnAndPlayWithKinect

Motion sensors are electronic devices which allows to detect moving objects. The main purpose of such a motion detector is to perform a certain action e.g. detection of a thief in home or switching the lights. These devices are mainly known for non-complicated structure and their main job is predetermined. This situation has changed due to the engineers and designers of industrial electronic equipment.

Few years ago a new device has been invented (still called motion detector), which allows to analyse recorded image and sound. This sensor could turn two-dimensional picture from the camera into three-dimensional workspace. When potential of such a device has been recognized, in human mind was born the idea of creating contactless user interface. This idea was not only limited to create a controller to replace the mouse or keyboard. The biggest corporations of the video game industry decided to design sensors based on gestures or movements.

This software was created for university thesis. The aim was to create an educational multimedia entertainment interface using touch-free sensor Microsoft Kinect. On the market there are many games available for the Xbox 360 console, which uses mentioned technology, still lacks educational games for children. An additional aim is to create a game that will be available for Microsoft Windows.
